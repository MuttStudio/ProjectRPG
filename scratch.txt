as you move from region to region you have a major goal at each region. You are destroying primary bases of the venrok in prepreation for the big attack at the end. At each region you might, fortify the base, help the locals, etc. as side quests. Your main quest though is to eventually take out the venrok base that is in that area. These regions are vantage points for attack. They are far enough away from them to not be noticed. As a game mechanic, if you help out the locals the venrok attack the city here and there based on the threat meter
